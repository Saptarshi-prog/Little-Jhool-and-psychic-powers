# Little-Jhool-and-psychic-powers
Little Jhool always wanted to have some psychic powers so that he could showoff his skills, and magic to people and impress them. (Specially, his girlfriend Big Jhool!) But, in spite all his efforts, hardwork, dedication, Googling, watching youtube videos he couldn't garner any psychic abilities!  He knew everyone was making fun of him, so to stop all of that - he came up with a smart plan. Anyone who came to him to know about their future, he asked them to write a binary number for him - and then, he smartly told them if the future for that person had good in store, or bad.
